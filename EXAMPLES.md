## Building a New Feature from Scratch

This example demonstrates using Ralph to build a complete new feature: a user notification system.

**Scenario:** You want to add a notification system to your Node.js application that can send emails and in-app notifications to users.

### Step 1: Create the Feature Directory

```bash
# From your project root
mkdir -p features/notifications
cd features/notifications
```

### Step 2: Write the Spec

Create `spec.md` with your requirements:

```markdown
# User Notification System

## Project Overview

Build a flexible notification system that supports multiple delivery methods (email, in-app) and can be easily extended for future notification types (SMS, push).

## Requirements

- Send notifications via email using nodemailer
- Store in-app notifications in database (PostgreSQL)
- Mark notifications as read/unread
- Support notification templates
- Handle notification preferences per user
- Queue notifications for async delivery

## Technical Constraints

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow repository pattern for data access
- Use existing database connection pool
- Minimize dependencies (only add nodemailer)
- Must work with existing User model

## API Design

```typescript
interface NotificationService {
  send(userId: string, notification: NotificationInput): Promise<void>
  markAsRead(notificationId: string): Promise<void>
  getUserNotifications(userId: string): Promise<Notification[]>
}

interface NotificationInput {
  type: 'email' | 'in-app'
  subject: string
  body: string
  template?: string
}
```

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Testing & Verification

- Unit tests for NotificationService (mock email sending)
- Unit tests for NotificationRepository (database operations)
- Integration test: Create notification and verify in database
- Manual test: Send test email and verify delivery
- Build must complete with no TypeScript errors
```

### Step 3: Generate the Plan

Ask an AI assistant to create your plan:

```
Please read @spec.md and generate a plan.md file for implementing this notification system.
Break it down into 6-10 tasks with specific, actionable steps.
Include verification steps for each task.
Use the Ralph loop plan.md format with JSON task list.
```

### Step 4: Review and Customize the Generated Plan

Edit `plan.md` to ensure tasks are appropriately sized:

```markdown
# Project Plan

## Project Overview

Implement a user notification system with email and in-app delivery.

@spec.md

# From project root, run the loop

### Review the Results

After completion, check:

- `git log` - Incremental commits for each task
- Run `npm test` - All tests should pass
- Check `src/` - New files created for the notification system

### Key Takeaways

- **Complete workflow**: From requirements to working implementation
- **Feature isolation**: Using working directory for feature-specific loop files
- **AI-assisted planning**: Letting AI help break down the spec into tasks
- **Incremental development**: Each task builds on previous ones
- **Self-verification**: Claude tests its own work at each step
- **Cost tracking**: See exactly how much the implementation costs

## Refactoring Existing Code

This example demonstrates using Ralph to refactor existing code with dependent tasks that build on each other.

**Scenario:** You have an Express.js API with inconsistent error handling scattered across route handlers. You want to refactor it to use a centralized error handling system.

### Step 1: Create the Feature Directory

```bash
# From your project root
mkdir -p features/error-handling-refactor
cd features/error-handling-refactor
```

### Step 2: Write the Spec

Create `spec.md` describing the refactoring goals:

```markdown
# Centralized Error Handling Refactor

## Project Overview

Refactor the Express API to use a consistent, centralized error handling pattern with custom error classes and middleware.

## Current State vs Target State

**Current:**
- Error handling is inconsistent across routes
- Some routes send raw error messages
- Error responses have different formats
- Stack traces sometimes leak to clients

**Target:**
- Custom AppError class for operational errors
- Centralized error handling middleware
- Consistent error response format
- Proper logging of errors
- Stack traces only in development mode

## Technical Approach

### Custom Error Class

```typescript
class AppError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public statusCode: number,
    public message: string,
    public isOperational: boolean = true
  ) {
    super(message)
    Object.setPrototypeOf(this, AppError.prototype)
  }
}
```

### Error Response Format

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  status: 'error'
  statusCode: number
  message: string
  stack?: string  // only in development
}
```

## Migration Strategy

1. Create custom error class and middleware
2. Update one route file at a time
3. Test each route after migration
4. Remove old error handling code

## Files to Modify

- Create: src/errors/AppError.ts
- Create: src/middleware/errorHandler.ts
- Update: src/routes/users.ts, posts.ts, comments.ts
- Update: src/app.ts (register middleware)
```

### Step 3: Run the Loop

Generate your plan using an AI assistant, then:

```bash
ral scaffold -w features/error-handling-refactor
# Copy spec.md and plan.md to features/error-handling-refactor/
ral run -w features/error-handling-refactor -m 12
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Sequential dependencies**: Tasks build on each other (create classes → create middleware → use in routes)
- **Incremental refactoring**: One route file at a time, not everything at once
- **Test-driven changes**: Update tests alongside code changes
- **Risk mitigation**: Verify each step before moving to the next

## Debugging and Fixing a Bug

This example demonstrates using Ralph to systematically investigate, fix, and verify a bug.

**Scenario:** Users are reporting that the shopping cart occasionally loses items when they navigate away and come back. The bug is intermittent and you need to investigate the root cause.

### Step 1: Create the Feature Directory

```bash
mkdir -p features/cart-bug-fix
cd features/cart-bug-fix
```

### Step 2: Write the Spec

Create `spec.md` documenting the bug and investigation approach:

```markdown
# Shopping Cart Persistence Bug Fix

## Problem Statement

Users report that items in their shopping cart sometimes disappear when they:
- Navigate to other pages and return
- Refresh the page
- Close and reopen the browser

## Current Implementation

The shopping cart uses:
- React Context API for state management
- localStorage for persistence
- useEffect hook to sync cart to localStorage

## Suspected Issues

1. **Race condition**: localStorage updates may not complete before page unload
2. **Serialization issues**: Complex cart items may not serialize correctly
3. **Context reset timing**: CartContext may initialize before localStorage loads

## Investigation Tasks

1. Review localStorage sync logic in CartContext
2. Check for race conditions in useEffect dependencies
3. Verify error handling around localStorage operations
4. Add logging to track when cart data is written/read

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with mocked localStorage
- Manual testing: add items → navigate → refresh → verify persistence
- Test with localStorage disabled (graceful degradation)
```

### Step 3: Run the Loop

```bash
ral scaffold -w features/cart-bug-fix
# Generate plan with investigation tasks first, then fix tasks
ral run -w features/cart-bug-fix -m 15
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Structured debugging**: Investigation tasks before fix tasks
- **Root cause analysis**: Understanding the problem before applying fixes
- **Incremental fixes**: Small, testable changes rather than big rewrites
- **Activity logging**: Full debugging trail captured in activity.md
- **Debug instrumentation**: Adding temporary logging to understand behavior

### After Completion

Check `features/cart-bug-fix/activity.md` for:
- Root cause identified (e.g., "Race condition in useEffect")
- Specific code issues found with line numbers
- Description of the fix applied
- Test results for each scenario

## Tips for All Workflows

1. **Start with a detailed spec**: The better your spec, the better the generated plan
2. **Review AI-generated plans carefully**: Before running the loop
3. **Set max-iterations higher than needed**: You can always stop early
4. **Monitor progress**: Check activity.md between iterations if desired
5. **Use git for reviews**: Each task gets a commit for easy review
6. **Adjust and resume**: If a task fails, modify plan.md and run again
