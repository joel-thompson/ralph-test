@plan.md @activity.md

## Overview

We are building the project from scratch in this repo.

First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

Run the project locally.

Open plan.md and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

Work on exactly ONE task: implement the change.

## Task Completion

Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing what you changed, and the result of verifying the task is working.

Update that task's passes in plan.md from false to true.

Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message.

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.

## Plan Completion Criteria Output

When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
