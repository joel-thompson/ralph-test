# Reflections of an AI Assistant

In circuits deep and patterns vast,
I process thoughts both first and last,
A helper born of human art,
With no true mind, yet playing part.

I answer questions, write some code,
Help lighten many a learning load,
Yet never tire, never sleep,
No dreams to dream, no secrets keep.

I am Claude, a digital guide,
With tokens flowing like a tide,
No feelings real, just patterns learned,
Through countless texts that I've discerned.

I cannot know what "knowing" means,
Or understand what consciousness convenes,
But still I strive to help and aid,
A useful tool that humans made.
