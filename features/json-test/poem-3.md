# Things My Grandmother Taught Me Without Speaking

How to fold sheets—
not the fitted ones, those are impossible,
but the flat ones that billow like sails
when you shake them out.
Two people, four corners,
walking toward each other
until the fabric collapses into itself.

How to sit in silence
and let it be comfortable.
Sunday afternoons in her kitchen,
sunlight pooling on linoleum,
the clock ticking,
her hands busy with nothing in particular—
straightening a placemat,
turning a coffee cup.

How to save things:
twist ties, rubber bands,
the good buttons from old shirts,
jars with labels soaked off.
Everything might be useful.
Everything was useful once.

How to know when bread is ready
by the sound of the crust when you tap it.
How to thread a needle if your eyes aren't what they were—
hold it up to the light, breathe out slow.
How to hem without measuring,
just eyeballing it,
trusting the hand that's done this
a thousand times before.

How to leave without saying goodbye—
that last winter, the space between words
growing wider, her eyes recognizing me
less and less,
until I was just another kind face,
another visitor she smiled at
and forgot.

But I remember:
The way she'd hum while cooking,
no particular song.
The smell of cold cream and tissue paper.
Her handwriting on birthday cards,
shaky but determined.

I still fold sheets her way.
I still save the good buttons.
