## Session Log

### 2026-01-28 - Task 0: Write poem 1 and save it to features/json-test/poem-1.md

**Task Description:** Create the first of three distinct poems.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `features/json-test/poem-1.md` with "The Clockmaker's Daughter"
- Poem theme: craftsmanship, tradition, patience, and mechanical artistry
- Structure: 4 stanzas, 4 lines each, AABB rhyme scheme

**Verification Results:**
- File created successfully at `features/json-test/poem-1.md`
- Confirmed no other poem files (poem-2.md, poem-3.md) exist yet
- Directory listing verified only poem-1.md is present alongside other project files

**Dependencies:**
- None required

**Notes:**
- Chose a specific, concrete theme (clockmaking) to ensure distinctiveness from future poems
- Used consistent structure and formal rhyme to establish one poetic voice/style
- Next poems should use different themes, structures, or voices to ensure variety

### 2026-01-28 - Task 1: Write poem 2 and save it to features/json-test/poem-2.md

**Task Description:** Create the second of three distinct poems with different theme/structure from poem 1.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `features/json-test/poem-2.md` with "Storm at the Edge of the World"
- Poem theme: nature's power, human vulnerability, wild storms
- Structure: free verse (no rhyme scheme), irregular line lengths, enjambment
- Voice: urgent, visceral, present-tense immediacy vs. poem 1's calm reflection

**Verification Results:**
- File created successfully at `features/json-test/poem-2.md`
- Confirmed poem-1.md remains intact and unchanged
- Directory listing shows both poem-1.md and poem-2.md present
- Poem-3.md does not exist yet (as expected)

**Dependencies:**
- None required

**Notes:**
- Deliberately chose contrasting elements from poem 1:
  - Theme: raw nature vs. human craftsmanship
  - Form: free verse vs. formal AABB rhyme
  - Tone: wild/urgent vs. patient/meditative
  - Setting: outdoors/storm vs. indoors/workshop
- Next poem (poem 3) should differ from both existing poems

### 2026-01-28 - Task 2: Write poem 3 and save it to features/json-test/poem-3.md

**Task Description:** Create the third of three distinct poems with different theme/structure/voice from poems 1 and 2.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `features/json-test/poem-3.md` with "Things My Grandmother Taught Me Without Speaking"
- Poem theme: memory, family, intergenerational knowledge, loss, and intimate personal history
- Structure: irregular stanzas (varying lengths), conversational free verse, list-like sections
- Voice: reflective, intimate, conversational (first-person "I") vs. third-person observation (poem 1) and second-person immediacy (poem 2)
- Tone: nostalgic, tender, bittersweet with specific domestic details

**Verification Results:**
- File created successfully at `features/json-test/poem-3.md` (52 lines)
- Confirmed poem-1.md remains intact (21 lines, unchanged)
- Confirmed poem-2.md remains intact (33 lines, unchanged)
- Directory listing shows all three poem files present
- All project success criteria met: three distinct poems in separate files

**Dependencies:**
- None required

**Notes:**
- Deliberately chose contrasting elements from both previous poems:
  - Theme: intimate personal/family memory vs. craftsmanship (poem 1) vs. raw nature (poem 2)
  - Form: conversational free verse with irregular stanzas vs. formal rhyme (poem 1) vs. urgent free verse (poem 2)
  - Tone: tender/nostalgic vs. meditative (poem 1) vs. visceral/urgent (poem 2)
  - Voice: first-person intimate vs. third-person observational (poem 1) vs. second-person immediacy (poem 2)
  - Setting: domestic/kitchen/everyday life vs. workshop (poem 1) vs. storm/cliff (poem 2)
  - Content: specific personal memories and instructions vs. abstract craftsmanship vs. confrontation with nature
- All three poems are meaningfully distinct in theme, structure, voice, and imagery
- Project complete: all success criteria fulfilled
