# Storm at the Edge of the World

The wind doesn't ask permission—
it takes the cliff face,
tears at the roots of ancient pines
until they bow like penitents.

Rain comes sideways,
a thousand needles
stitching sky to stone,
and I am standing
where the earth decides to stop.

Below: the sea's rage,
white foam teeth
gnashing at basalt,
a sound older than names,
older than the idea of shelter.

My jacket snaps like a flag.
My breath is stolen before it leaves my lungs.
This is what it means
to be small—
to feel the planet flex beneath your feet
and know
you were never in control.

The storm doesn't care
that I drove three hours to see it.
It would swallow me
as easily as mist,
and continue
long after I'm gone.
