# The Clockmaker's Daughter

She winds the gears with steady hands,
Each spring and cog in copper bands,
While pendulums trace arcs of time
Through workshop air thick with grime.

Her father's tools rest in their place,
Each bearing marks of his embrace—
The files worn smooth, the vice's jaw
Still holding fast to nature's law.

Outside, the world moves swift and strange,
But here within, the things that change
Are measured out in ticks and tocks,
In mainsprings, escapements, balance cocks.

She knows that every wheel must turn
In sequence, as the minutes burn,
That patience is the craftsman's art—
To build a working, beating heart.
