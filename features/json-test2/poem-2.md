# Subway at Rush Hour

Bodies pressed like pages in a book
no one wants to read.

The fluorescent lights hum
a frequency just below recognition,
and somewhere beneath the screech of brakes
a busker's saxophone
bleeds into the tunnel's mouth.

We are all
performing stillness,
eyes fixed on phones or middle distance,
masters of the art
of being alone together.

A child laughs—
sudden, inappropriate, true—
and for a moment
we almost remember
what it meant to take up space
without apologizing for it.

Then the doors close.
The train lurches forward.
We return to our careful
choreography of avoidance,
each of us an island
in an archipelago
that moves as one.
