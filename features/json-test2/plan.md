# Project Plan

## Project Overview

Create three separate poems, each saved as its own file in `features/json-test2/`.

Target outputs:

- `features/json-test2/poem-1.md`
- `features/json-test2/poem-2.md`
- `features/json-test2/poem-3.md`

Each poem should be distinct in theme, voice, and imagery (not three variations of the same poem).

## Success Criteria

- All three poem files exist in `features/json-test2/`.
- Each file contains exactly one complete poem.
- Poems are meaningfully different from each other (tone/theme/structure).
