### 2026-01-28 - Task 1: Write Poem 1

**Task Description:** Write poem 1 and save it to features/json-test2/poem-1.md

**Changes Made:**
- Created new file features/json-test2/poem-1.md
- Wrote complete poem titled "The Clockmaker's Daughter"
- Poem has distinct theme (craftsmanship, legacy, patience), voice (narrative/reflective), and imagery (clockmaking workshop, tools, gears)
- Verified no other poem files exist yet (poem-2.md and poem-3.md not present)

**Verification Results:**
- File created at correct path features/json-test2/poem-1.md: ✓
- Contains one complete poem (28 lines): ✓
- Poem has distinct theme and imagery: ✓
- No other poem files were affected (none existed): ✓

**Dependencies Installed:** None

**Notes:** Successfully created poem-1.md in the correct directory (json-test2). The poem follows a narrative/reflective voice about a clockmaker's daughter learning her father's craft, with imagery centered on clockmaking tools, gears, and the passage of time.

### 2026-01-28 - Task 2: Write Poem 2

**Task Description:** Write poem 2 and save it to features/json-test2/poem-2.md

**Changes Made:**
- Created new file features/json-test2/poem-2.md
- Wrote complete poem titled "Subway at Rush Hour"
- Poem is distinctly different from poem 1:
  - Theme: Urban isolation and modern disconnection (vs. craftsmanship/legacy)
  - Structure: Free verse with irregular line breaks (vs. ABAB rhyme scheme)
  - Voice: Immediate/observational present tense (vs. narrative past/reflective)
  - Imagery: Subway, crowds, fluorescent lights, urban transit (vs. clockmaking workshop)
- Verified poem-1.md remains unchanged

**Verification Results:**
- File created at correct path features/json-test2/poem-2.md: ✓
- Contains one complete poem (31 lines, free verse): ✓
- Poem is clearly different from poem 1 in theme, structure, and imagery: ✓
- Poem-1.md remains unchanged (974 bytes, last modified before this task): ✓
- No other poem files were affected: ✓

**Dependencies Installed:** None

**Notes:** Successfully created poem-2.md with a modern, urban-themed free verse poem that contrasts sharply with poem-1's traditional narrative structure. The shift from workshop to subway, craftsmanship to alienation, and rhymed verse to free verse ensures the poems are meaningfully distinct.

### 2026-01-28 - Task 3: Write Poem 3

**Task Description:** Write poem 3 and save it to features/json-test2/poem-3.md

**Changes Made:**
- Created new file features/json-test2/poem-3.md
- Wrote complete poem titled "After the Storm"
- Poem is distinctly different from poems 1 and 2:
  - Theme: Nature, disaster recovery, community resilience (vs. craftsmanship/legacy or urban isolation)
  - Structure: Free verse with short stanzas and terse language (vs. ABAB rhyme or fluid observational)
  - Voice: First-person communal "we" narrative (vs. third-person narrative or detached observation)
  - Imagery: Storm damage, oak tree, creek, neighborhood recovery (vs. clockmaking or subway)
  - Tone: Raw, immediate aftermath with hope (vs. reflective nostalgia or modern alienation)
- Verified poems 1 and 2 remain unchanged

**Verification Results:**
- File created at correct path features/json-test2/poem-3.md: ✓
- Contains one complete poem (38 lines, free verse with stanzas): ✓
- Poem is clearly different from both poem 1 and 2 in theme, voice, structure, and imagery: ✓
- Poem-1.md remains unchanged (974 bytes, last modified 12:53): ✓
- Poem-2.md remains unchanged (666 bytes, last modified 12:53): ✓
- All three poem files now exist in features/json-test2/: ✓

**Dependencies Installed:** None

**Notes:** Successfully created poem-3.md with a nature/disaster recovery theme that stands apart from both previous poems. The communal "we" voice, storm imagery, and focus on community response creates a distinct third perspective. All three poems are now complete with meaningfully different themes, structures, and voices as required by the project plan.
