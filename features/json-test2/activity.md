- Verified no other poem files exist yet (poem-2.md and poem-3.md not present)

**Verification Results:**

### 2026-01-28 - Task 2: Write Poem 2

**Task Description:** Write poem 2 and save it to features/json-test2/poem-2.md

**Changes Made:**
- Created new file features/json-test2/poem-2.md
- Wrote complete poem titled "Subway at Rush Hour"
- Poem is distinctly different from poem 1:
  - Theme: Urban isolation and modern disconnection (vs. craftsmanship/legacy)
  - Structure: Free verse with irregular line breaks (vs. ABAB rhyme scheme)
  - Voice: Immediate/observational present tense (vs. narrative past/reflective)
  - Imagery: Subway, crowds, fluorescent lights, urban transit (vs. clockmaking workshop)
- Verified poem-1.md remains unchanged

**Verification Results:**
- File created at correct path features/json-test2/poem-2.md: ✓
- Contains one complete poem (31 lines, free verse): ✓
- Poem is clearly different from poem 1 in theme, structure, and imagery: ✓
- Poem-1.md remains unchanged (974 bytes, last modified before this task): ✓
- No other poem files were affected: ✓

**Dependencies Installed:** None

**Notes:** Successfully created poem-2.md with a modern, urban-themed free verse poem that contrasts sharply with poem-1's traditional narrative structure. The shift from workshop to subway, craftsmanship to alienation, and rhymed verse to free verse ensures the poems are meaningfully distinct.
