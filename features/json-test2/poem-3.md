# After the Storm

The oak stands stripped,
bark peeled back like old wallpaper
revealing the pale flesh underneath.

Lightning doesn't apologize.

Down by the creek,
the water runs thick with red clay,
swallowing fence posts and forgotten tools,
rewriting the map of where things belong.

My neighbor's greenhouse is a skeleton now—
glass scattered like ice across the lawn,
tomatoes still green on their stalks,
reaching toward a roof that isn't there.

We gather in the street
with chainsaws and work gloves,
speaking the sparse language of disaster:
"You okay?" "Yeah, you?"

The sky is scrubbed clean,
that particular blue that follows violence,
innocent as a child's crayon,
as if it doesn't know what it's done.

By evening, someone's brought coffee,
someone else a generator.
We work until dark,
learning the neighborhood
one fallen tree at a time.

The oak, split down the middle,
still holds on with half its roots.
Come spring, they say,
it might surprise us.
