# The Clockmaker's Daughter

In her father's workshop, dust motes turn like stars,
Each gear a constellation mapped in brass.
She learns the language spoken by the springs,
The patience written in the pendulum's pass.

Her hands, still small, manipulate the wheels
With reverence for time they cannot hold.
The ticking is a heartbeat she can trust,
More constant than the stories she's been told.

At night, the clocks all argue with the dark—
Some racing forward, eager for the dawn,
While others hesitate, reluctant, slow,
As if they know what happens when time's gone.

She winds them each with care her father taught:
Not too much tension, not too loose a spring.
The balance is the secret, he would say,
Between the silence and the song they sing.

Years later, when his hands have lost their strength,
She'll be the keeper of the measured hours,
Translating minutes into motion, life
Into the mechanical, this gift of ours—

To hold, however briefly, time itself.
